1. MOV [destination] [source] - Copies Data From Source (Register, Memory Reference, Constant) 
    To Destination (Register Or Memory Reference)

2. VAR: [type] [value] - Defines A Name And A Value For Variable Or A Label

3. ARRAY: [type] [value1], [value2]... - Defines An Array Or List Of Labels With Same type

4. STACK(TERM) - Something I Know From C

5.Interrupts(TERM) - A Signal Which Makes The Processor Stop What It's Doing, In Order To Handle That Signal
Triggers : 
    -An Exception -> A Crictical Error(Dividing By Zero, Segmentation Fault, Page Fault)
    -Hardware(Keyboard Press, Timer Tick, Disk Controller Finishing An Operation)
    -Sofware (INT Instruction)
    Example For Software Interrupts That Is Builtin On BIOS:
        INT 10h -- Video
        INT 11h -- Equidment Check
        INT 12h -- Memory Size
        INT 13h -- Disk I/Of
        INT 14h -- Serial Communication
        INT 15h -- Cassete
        INT 16h -- Keyboard I/O

    Example Of Usage : We Can Use VIDEO Interrupts To Print Text On Screen
    VIDEO Modes : (INT 10h)
        AH = 00h -- Set Video Mode
        AH = 01h -- Set Cursor Shape
        AH = 02h -- Set Cursor Position
        AH = 03h -- Get Cursor Position And Shape
        ...
        AH = 0Eh -- Write Charachter In TTY Mode
        ...

        If We Use AH=0Eh:
            AH = 0Eh
            AL = ASCII Charachter To Write
            BH = Page Number (Text Modes)
            BL = Foreground Pixel Color (Graphics Mode)

            Does Not Return Anything

            -Cursor Advances After Write
            -Charachters BEL (7), BS (8), LF (A), And CR (D) Are Treated As Control Codes
 

6. FILE SYSTEM(TERM) - A Method Of Organizing Pieces Of Data (Files) On A Disk

7. CMPSB - Compares The Two Bytes Located In Memory Addresses ds:si And es:di
si and di Are Incremented (When Direction Flag = 0) Or Decremented (When Direction Flag = 1)
Comparison Is Performed Simiarly To The CMP Instruction - A Substraction Is Performed
, And The Flags Are Set Accordingly.
cmpsw, cmpsd, cmpsq Are Equivalent For Comparing Words, Double Words, Quads.

8. REPE - Repeats A String Instruction While The Operands Are Equal (Zero Flag = 1), Or Until cx Reaches 0
cx Is Decremented On Each Iteration
Comparison Is Performed Simiarly To The CMP Instruction - A Substraction Is Performed
,And The Flags Are Set Accordingly.
